            I began my software journey in 2021 by building on the knowledge I
            gained at school, and in 2022 I took my first professional step into
            the industry at Privia Security. Over the past 3 years, I have
            gained solid experience in frontend development, creating
            user-focused, high-performance, and scalable web applications.
            Throughout this journey, I have not only written code but also
            focused on solving complex problems, researching and applying new
            technologies, and working harmoniously within teams. My goal in
            every project has been to deliver sustainable solutions that combine
            functionality with a refined user experience. Today, as a frontend
            developer driven by continuous learning and growth, I am always
            ready to take on new challenges, develop creative solutions, and
            bring value to every project I contribute to.
